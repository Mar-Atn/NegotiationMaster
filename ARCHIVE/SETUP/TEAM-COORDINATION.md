message_received    # New message from AI character
ai_typing          # AI character is typing
negotiation_update # Status/state changes
```

## Immediate Handoff Requirements

### Backend → Frontend (READY FOR HANDOFF)
- ✅ API endpoint documentation with examples
- ✅ AI character API endpoints with 3 character personalities
- ✅ Negotiation session management API 
- ✅ Complete scenario system with 3 difficulty levels
- 🔄 Socket.io event specifications (in progress)
- ✅ Sample character personality data (Sarah Chen, Marcus Thompson, Tony Rodriguez)

## Current Focus: Real-time Chat Integration

**Backend Captain Status**: Core AI character system COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ Character behavior profiles based on negotiation theory
- ✅ Database schema for character configurations and negotiation tracking
- ✅ API endpoints for character interaction and scenario management
- ✅ 3 fully implemented scenarios (Used Car, Salary, High-Pressure Sales)
- 🔄 Socket.io real-time chat implementation
- ⏳ OpenAI GPT-4 integration for realistic AI responses

**Ready for Frontend Wizard**: All core API endpoints are live and tested. Frontend can begin building UI components immediately.

**Next Priority**: Complete Socket.io integration for real-time chat functionality
