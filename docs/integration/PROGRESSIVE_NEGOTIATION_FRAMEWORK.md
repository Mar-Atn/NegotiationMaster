# Progressive Negotiation Training Framework
## Harvard Negotiation Project Methodology Implementation

### Overview
This framework implements a comprehensive, progressive negotiation training system based on Harvard Negotiation Project principles. The system provides 7 carefully designed scenarios that build skills from basic distributive negotiations to complex multi-party stakeholder management.
