# SPRINT 1 SCOPE CORRECTION DOCUMENT
## Critical Project Realignment - Immediate Action Required

**Date**: August 2, 2025  
**Status**: URGENT CORRECTION NEEDED  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  

---

## SITUATION ANALYSIS

### Scope Drift Identified
- Current implementation contains **1,596 lines** of over-engineered real-time features
- Features implemented that are **NOT** in PRD requirements
- Sprint 1 has deviated significantly from actual business requirements

### PRD Compliance Check
**Section 3.1.4 Post-Conversation Analysis** specifies ONLY:
1. Immediate Feedback: AI-generated assessment of negotiation performance
2. Skill Breakdown: Analysis across three dimensions (claiming value, creating value, relationship management)
3. Conversation Transcript: Full text record of the conversation
4. Improvement Suggestions: Specific, actionable recommendations for skill development

---

## COMPONENTS TO REMOVE (Over-Implementation)

### 1. LiveFeedback.js (475 lines) - REMOVE ENTIRELY
**Over-implemented features:**
- Real-time assessment during conversation
- Live skill tracking with progress bars
- Real-time coaching tips
- Complex 3D skill widgets
- Live performance scoring

**Why remove:** PRD specifies "Post-Conversation" analysis, not real-time

### 2. NegotiationAnalytics.js (561 lines) - REMOVE ENTIRELY  
**Over-implemented features:**
- 16 different metrics tracking
- Real-time tactical analysis
- Complex price progression tracking
- Live BATNA utilization scoring
- Advanced emotional control monitoring

**Why remove:** Too complex for MVP, not in PRD requirements

### 3. ConversationFeedback.js - SIMPLIFY DRASTICALLY
**Remove these features:**
- Complex accordion interfaces
- Multiple animation frameworks
- Advanced state management
- Comprehensive feedback API calls
- Over-engineered UI components

**Keep only:** Simple post-conversation summary

## TEAM COORDINATION ACTIONS

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Developer Team**: Stop all work on analytics components
2. **Lead Developer**: Review and approve scope reduction
3. **PM**: Communicate scope change to stakeholders
4. **QA**: Update test plans to reflect simplified scope

### Communication Plan
1. **Team Meeting**: Today - Review scope correction
2. **Stakeholder Update**: Today - Explain PRD alignment
3. **Daily Standups**: Focus on scope compliance

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Identified Risks
1. **Technical Debt**: Over-engineered components
2. **Time Loss**: 40+ hours of development wasted
3. **Confusion**: Team unclear on actual requirements

### Mitigation Strategies
