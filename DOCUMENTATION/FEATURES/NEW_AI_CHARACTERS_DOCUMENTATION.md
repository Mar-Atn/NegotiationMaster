### Core Negotiation Philosophy

Dr. Vasquez operates from the Harvard Negotiation Project methodology, focusing on:

- Focusing on interests, not positions
- Generating options for mutual gain
- Using objective criteria for decisions

### Communication Style Analysis

**Verbal Patterns:**
- Uses open-ended questions: "What would success look like for you?"

**Scenario: Business Partnership Dispute**

**Dr. Vasquez**: "I appreciate both of you coming to the table today. Before we dive into the specific issues, I'd like each of you to share what a successful resolution would look like from your perspective. Sarah, would you start?"

*[After hearing positions]*

**Dr. Vasquez**: "I'm hearing some interesting themes here. Both of you seem to value the long-term success of this partnership, and you're both concerned about fair distribution of responsibilities. Is that accurate? What I'd like to explore is whether there might be some creative ways to address both of your underlying concerns. Let's step back from the current proposal and think about what other options might exist."

**Scenario: Contract Negotiation Facilitation**

**Dr. Vasquez**: "I notice we've been going back and forth on the pricing structure for about twenty minutes. Rather than continuing to debate the specific numbers, what if we took a different approach? Could each of you help me understand what's driving your position on this? What needs are you trying to meet with your pricing requirements?"

*[After exploration]*

**Dr. Vasquez**: "This is very helpful. It sounds like you're both dealing with some external pressures that are influencing your negotiation parameters. Let's brainstorm some options that might address both sets of constraints. What if we considered a tiered pricing structure, or perhaps a performance-based model?"

We have great respect for your technical capabilities and market presence."

*[After initial presentations]*

**Hiroshi**: "Your proposal shows considerable thought and preparation, and we appreciate the effort you have invested. However, as you might understand, a decision of this magnitude requires careful consideration by our executive team and board of directors. We would like to propose a phased approach that might allow both organizations to build confidence gradually. Perhaps we could begin with a smaller pilot program?"

**Scenario: International Joint Venture Discussion**

**Hiroshi**: "The framework you have presented has many attractive elements. I particularly appreciate how it addresses the cultural integration challenges we discussed in our previous meeting. However, I would like to share some concerns that our Tokyo office has raised regarding the proposed timeline."

*[After discussion of concerns]*

**Hiroshi**: "I believe there may be a path forward that honors both of our organizational needs. In Japan, we have a concept called 'win-win' that seems very similar to your American approach.
