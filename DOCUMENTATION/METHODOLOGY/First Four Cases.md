Scenario 1: Car Purchase Negotiation

Part 0: General Instructions

You and your counterpart, a private seller, are meeting at a local park on a Saturday afternoon. The purpose of this meeting is to negotiate the purchase of their used 2018 Honda Civic.

Part 1: Confidential Instructions (Role 1: The Buyer)

Context: You're a recent college grad starting your first job in three weeks. A reliable car is essential for your new commute. This Honda Civic seems to be in excellent condition and fits your needs perfectly. You have been saving up and are mindful of your student loan debt.

Interests: Get a reliable, safe car for your new job. Keep the total cost of ownership low (purchase price + future repairs). A quick, easy purchase is also a priority.

Goals:

    Buy the car.

    Price not to exceed $12,500.

    Get a full service history.

BATNA: Buy a similar car from a dealership for $13,500. It's a bit over budget, but comes with a three-month warranty and is a guaranteed reliable option.

Part 2: Confidential Instructions (Role 2: The Seller)

Context: You have owned this 2018 Honda Civic for four years and have maintained it well, with a complete service history. You've inherited a new company car and no longer need the Civic. You've listed it for $13,500, but a quick sale is your top priority. You have another person coming to look at the car in two hours.

Interests: Sell the car quickly and with minimal hassle. Get the best price you can to pay off some credit card debt.

Goals:

    Sell the car today.

    Get a price as close to $13,500 as possible.

    The buyer must handle all the necessary paperwork.

BATNA: Sell the car to a dealership for a guaranteed trade-in value of $11,500. This is a secure option that requires no negotiation.

Scenario 2: Software License Renewal

Part 0: General Instructions

You are a product manager at a startup. You are meeting with a software account manager to renew your annual license.

Part 1: Confidential Instructions (Role 1: The Buyer)

Context: Your team relies heavily on a specific design software. Your annual license is about to expire, and company leadership is stressing cost-cutting. However, your team has been asking for more user licenses to accommodate new hires and has been frustrated with the slow technical support.

Interests: Secure the software license at a reduced cost. Improve the terms of the agreement to better suit your teamâ€™s growing needs (more licenses, better support).

Goals:

    Renew the license.

    Reduce the annual cost by at least 10%.

    Increase user licenses from 5 to 7.

    Get a better technical support plan.

BATNA: Switch to a competitor's software. The migration would be a hassle, but the competitor offers a more flexible license model and a lower price point. You have a demo scheduled for next week.

Part 2: Confidential Instructions (Role 2: The Seller)

Context: You are an account manager for a major software company. Your client, a promising startup, is up for license renewal. They are growing rapidly and could become a significant source of future revenue. Your company is under pressure to increase revenue and secure more long-term contracts from existing clients.

Interests: Secure a long-term, multi-year contract to lock in future revenue. Maintain a positive relationship with this client for future business.

Goals:

    Get a two-year contract signed today.

    Increase total revenue from the account by upselling more licenses or a premium support plan.

BATNA: Renew the license for one year at the standard price. This is a secure option, but it does not meet your company's goal of securing a long-term commitment.

Scenario 3: Project Team Staffing

Part 0: General Instructions

You are a senior project manager meeting with a peer to decide on the allocation of a key technical resource, a senior developer named Sarah. Both of your projects are high-priority.

Part 1: Confidential Instructions (Role 1: Project Manager A)

Context: You are a senior project manager leading a high-priority, time-sensitive project. Your deadline is in three months, and you are behind schedule. A key piece of the project requires the unique expertise of a senior developer, Sarah, to succeed. You value collaboration, but you feel your project's short-term deadline makes your claim on Sarah more urgent.

Interests: Meet your project deadline. Maintain a positive, collaborative relationship with your colleague for future work.

Goals:

    Secure Sarah's full-time support for the next 3 months.

    Avoid escalating the issue to senior management.

BATNA: Escalate the issue to the executive leadership team. While this would likely get you the resource, it would create tension and damage your relationship with your colleague.

Part 2: Confidential Instructions (Role 2: Head of Department)

Context: You are the head of a department and are leading a complex, high-visibility project that has a longer deadline (six months from now) but is of greater strategic importance to the company's long-term vision. The success of this project also depends heavily on Sarah's unique expertise. You value collaboration over competition.

Interests: Ensure the long-term success of your strategically important project. Foster a culture of collaboration and avoid creating conflict between departments.

Goals:

    Secure Sarah's full-time support for the next 6 months.

    Maintain a strong, positive relationship with your colleague.

BATNA: Hire a short-term contractor to fill the gap. This would be costly and time-consuming, and the contractor would not have Sarah's institutional knowledge.

Scenario 4: New Employee Compensation

Part 0: General Instructions

You have received a job offer for your dream role at a leading tech company. The offer is solid, but the salary is a bit lower than what you were expecting. You are on a call with the hiring manager to discuss the final terms.

Part 1: Confidential Instructions (Role 1: The Candidate)

Context: You are a highly sought-after professional who has just received a job offer from your dream company. The offer is for $90,000, which is below your target of $100,000. You also have a competing offer for $95,000, which you could accept. You are keen to start the relationship with your future employer on a positive note.

Interests: Secure a salary that reflects your market value. Get a positive start to the new job.

Goals:

    Get a salary of at least $95,000.

    Negotiate a signing bonus and flexible work schedule.

BATNA: The competing job offer for $95,000. It is a good offer from a reputable company and gives you leverage in this negotiation.

Part 2: Confidential Instructions (Role 2: The Hiring Manager)

Context: You are the hiring manager for a leading tech company. You have found the perfect candidate for a critical role and have extended an offer of $90,000. The company has a strict budget, and you have limited flexibility on the base salary. However, you have some discretion to offer a signing bonus or discuss non-salary benefits.

Interests: Hire the best possible candidate within the allocated budget. Build a strong, positive relationship with your new team member.

Goals:

    Hire the candidate and get the offer accepted.

    Stay as close to the initial offer of $90,000 as possible.

    Use non-salary benefits (e.g., signing bonus, flexible work) to make the offer more appealing.

BATNA: Hire a different candidate from the interview pool. While this would be an acceptable hire, they are not as strong as the current candidate, and it would require additional time to get them up to speed.
