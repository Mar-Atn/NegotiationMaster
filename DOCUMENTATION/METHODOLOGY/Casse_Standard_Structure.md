### **Case Standard Structure for NegotiationsMaster (NM)**

Thank you for the additional feedback. Adding a "General Instructions" section is an excellent idea as it creates a shared reality for both parties and further streamlines the process. This final structure is pedagogically sound, compact, and optimized for our AI-driven platform.

Here is the finalized structure for each NMnscenario:

#### **Part 0: General Instructions**
This is a super short context text, visible to both parties (the human learner and the AI character). It sets the stage for the negotiation with a few key, shared facts.

* **Example:** "You are both meeting at the 'Coffee Corner' cafe to discuss the terms of a new project. The current agreement is about to expire, and a new one needs to be reached."

#### **Part 1 & 2: Confidential Instructions (Role 1 & Role 2)**
These instructions will be in simple, plain text paragraphs, providing the specific, private details for each role. The structure may vary slightly to suit the learning goals of the scenario.

* **Context:** A brief, role-specific background story.
* **Interests:** The character's core motivations and priorities.
* **Goals & Priorities:** The specific objectives the character is trying to achieve.
* **BATNA:** The best alternative if the negotiation fails.
* **Note:** The level of explicitness for goals and BATNA can be adjusted based on the scenario's difficulty.

#### **Part 3: Teaching Notes**
This section is for internal use and will guide the AI feedback system. It is a structured text with bullet points.

* **Learning Objectives:** The key skills or concepts to be practiced.
* **Key Concepts:** A list of the negotiation theories or frameworks at play.
* **Difficulty Level:** A rating from 1 to 10.
* **Technical Parameters:**
    * **Expected Duration:** Target time for the simulation (e.g., 15-20 minutes).
* **Debriefing Focus:** Specific points for the AI to address in the post-simulation feedback, ensuring it aligns with the learning objectives and Kolb's learning cycle.

This finalized structure provides the ideal balance of realism, clarity, and pedagogical depth, ensuring an optimal user experience on the MetaGames platform.
