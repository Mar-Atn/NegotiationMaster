   User: "I was hoping for something closer to $420,000 given the pre-IPO timing and my experience."
   
   Dr. Foster: "I understand your perspective. The growth trajectory here is exceptional - we're actually ahead of our IPO timeline. The equity component of 85,000 shares could be quite valuable.
