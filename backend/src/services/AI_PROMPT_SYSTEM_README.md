## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install openai natural

# Set environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export USE_AI_ANALYSIS="true"
export ENABLE_HYBRID_ANALYSIS="true"
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
const AssessmentEngine = require('./assessmentEngine')

const assessmentEngine = new AssessmentEngine()

// Generate comprehensive analysis
const results = await assessmentEngine.generateComprehensiveAssessment(
  transcript,
  voiceMetrics,
  scenarioContext,
  userProfile
)

console.log('Analysis Mode:', results.analysisMode)
console.log('Overall Score:', results.overall)
console.log('Executive Summary:', results.executiveSummary)
```

### Scenario Context Structure

```javascript
const scenarioContext = {
  title: "Enterprise Software License Negotiation",
  type: "vendor_negotiation",
  industry: "technology",
  keyIssues: ["pricing structure", "service levels", "contract terms"],
  counterpartProfile: "Senior sales director with pricing authority",
  businessContext: "Annual renewal with expansion potential"
}
```

## Prompt Templates

### Master Analysis Prompt

The master prompt generates comprehensive assessment across all three dimensions:

```javascript
const feedbackPrompts = require('./feedbackPrompts')

const masterPrompt = feedbackPrompts.getMasterAnalysisPrompt(
  transcript,
  scenarioContext,
  voiceMetrics
)
```

### Dimension-Specific Prompts

For focused analysis on individual competencies:

```javascript
// Claiming Value (Competitive Skills)
const claimingPrompt = feedbackPrompts.getClaimingValuePrompt(transcript, scenarioContext)

// Creating Value (Collaborative Skills)  
const creatingPrompt = feedbackPrompts.getCreatingValuePrompt(transcript, scenarioContext)

// Relationship Management (Interpersonal Skills)
const relationshipPrompt = feedbackPrompts.getRelationshipManagementPrompt(
  transcript, 
  scenarioContext, 
  voiceMetrics
)
```

### Scenario-Specific Prompts

For specialized negotiation contexts:

```javascript
const scenarioPrompt = feedbackPrompts.getScenarioSpecificPrompt(
  'vendor_negotiation',
  transcript,
  scenarioContext
)
```

## Quality Validation

### Prompt Quality Validation

```javascript
const promptValidation = require('./promptValidation')

const validation = promptValidation.validatePromptQuality(
  promptData,
  transcript,
  scenarioContext
)

if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.log('Issues:', validation.issues)
  console.log('Recommendations:', validation.recommendations)
}
```

### AI Response Validation

```javascript
const responseValidation = promptValidation.validateAIResponse(
  aiResponse,
  originalPrompt
)

console.log('Quality Score:', responseValidation.score)
console.log('Educational Value:', responseValidation.isValid)
```

## Testing Framework

### Running Test Suite

```javascript
const PromptTesting = require('./promptTesting')

const tester = new PromptTesting()
const report = await tester.runFullTestSuite()

console.log('Test Results:', report.overview)
console.log('Recommendations:', report.recommendations)
```

### Individual Test Categories

```javascript
// Test prompt structures
await tester.testPromptStructures()

// Test AI response quality
await tester.testAIResponseQuality()

// Test educational value
await tester.testEducationalValue()

// Test performance consistency
await tester.testPerformanceConsistency()
```

## Example Scenarios

The system includes comprehensive examples for testing and validation:

### Vendor Contract Negotiation
- Enterprise software licensing
- Service level agreements
- Risk allocation and pricing

### Partnership Formation
- Joint venture structuring
- Revenue sharing models
- Governance frameworks

### Salary Negotiation
- Market-based compensation
- Performance incentives
- Career development planning

### Conflict Resolution
- Resource allocation disputes
- Interdepartmental negotiations
- Relationship repair

## Advanced Configuration

### Skill Level Adaptation

```javascript
const skillModifier = feedbackPrompts.getProgressiveDifficultyModifier('advanced')
```

Available levels: `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`, `expert`

### Industry Customization

```javascript
const industryModifier = feedbackPrompts.getIndustryContextModifier('technology')
```

Supported industries: `technology`, `healthcare`, `financial_services`, `manufacturing`

### Quality Control

```javascript
const qualityControl = feedbackPrompts.getQualityControlPrompt()
```

Ensures responses meet educational standards with:
- Minimum 3 conversation quotes per dimension
- Specific actionable recommendations
- Harvard Negotiation Method references
- Professional executive education tone

## Performance Optimization

### Hybrid Analysis Mode

Combines rule-based scoring with AI-enhanced feedback:

```javascript
// Rule-based scores provide validation
// AI analysis provides rich feedback
// System uses best of both approaches
```

### Fallback Mechanisms

```javascript
// If AI analysis fails, system falls back to rule-based assessment
// Ensures reliable operation even with API issues
// Maintains consistent user experience
```

### Token Usage Optimization

- Efficient prompt design minimizes token usage
- Structured response formats reduce parsing overhead
- Quality validation prevents unnecessary re-processing

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

```javascript
try {
  const aiResults = await aiEngine.generateComprehensiveAnalysis(...)
  // Use AI-enhanced results
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Falling back to rule-based analysis')
  const ruleBasedResults = assessmentEngine.generateRuleBasedAssessment(...)
  // Maintain service availability
}
```

### Quality Validation

```javascript
const qualityCheck = aiEngine.validateAnalysisQuality(aiResults)

if (!qualityCheck.isValid) {
  console.log('AI quality insufficient, using rule-based results')
  // Automatic quality control
}
```

## Deployment Guidelines

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Production environment variables
NODE_ENV=production
