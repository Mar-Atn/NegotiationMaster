const sampleTranscript = `User: I'm looking to negotiate a contract for software services. What can you offer?

Sarah Chen: I'd be happy to discuss our software services package. We typically provide comprehensive development support starting at $50,000 for a basic project. What specific requirements do you have?

User: That seems quite high. I have other options available that are significantly cheaper. What's your best price?

Sarah Chen: I understand cost is a concern. Our pricing reflects the quality and expertise we bring. What budget range were you considering?

User: I was thinking more like $30,000. If you can't meet that, I might need to explore my alternatives.

Sarah Chen: Let me understand what matters most to you in this project. Is it just the cost, or are there other priorities like timeline, support, or specific features?

User: Well, timeline is important too. I need this completed within 3 months, and I need ongoing support. What if we structure this differently - maybe a smaller initial scope with the option to expand?

Sarah Chen: That's a creative approach. We could start with a core module for $35,000 that includes 6 months of support, with options to add features as needed. Would that work better for your timeline and budget?

User: That sounds more reasonable. I appreciate you working with me on this. What would the support include exactly?

Sarah Chen: The support package includes 24/7 technical support, monthly consultations, and priority bug fixes. We also offer training for your team as part of the package.

User: Perfect. Let's move forward with this structure. I think this creates value for both of us.`
