## NegotiationMaster Project Status Assessment

**Assessment Date:** August 2, 2025  
**Project Phase:** Development/MVP Implementation  
**Assessed Against:** NM_PRD.md v1.0  

---

## üìç CURRENT STATUS

**Assessment Questions:**
- [‚úì] What exactly works right now?
- [‚úì] What are the current blocking issues?
- [‚úì] What was the last working version?
- [‚úì] How far are we from the original goal?

**Current State:**
```
Working Features:
- User Authentication System (JWT-based with refresh tokens)
- Voice Conversations with ElevenLabs Integration
- Single AI Character (Sarah Chen - Car Dealer)
- Basic Scenario Structure (1 active scenario)
- Real-time Performance Analytics (3 skills tracking)
- Academic Prototype Interface
- Database Schema Implementation
- WebSocket Real-time Communication

Blocking Issues:
- Only 1 of 5 required AI characters implemented
- Only 1 of 4 required scenarios active
- No admin functionality built
- No content management system
- No user progress tracking implementation
- No skill assessment/scoring system
- No post-conversation feedback generation
- No scenario progression logic

Last Working Version:
- v2.0.0-case-specific-intelligence (voice-integration-experiment branch)
- Voice conversations functional with Sarah Chen character

Distance from Goal:
- Medium/Far - Core voice functionality works but missing 70% of PRD features
```

## üîç PROBLEM ANALYSIS

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- [‚úì] What's the ONE biggest obstacle?
- [‚úì] Is the current approach the right one?
- [‚úì] What would we do differently if starting fresh?
- [‚úì] Are we solving the right problem?

**Analysis Results:**
```
Biggest Obstacle:
- Lack of complete content (characters, scenarios) and assessment engine

Approach Assessment:
- Current approach: Partially Right - Voice tech works but content/analytics incomplete

Fresh Start Approach:
- Build complete content management system first
- Implement all 5 characters before voice integration
- Create assessment engine early in development

Problem Validation:
- Yes - Building voice-powered negotiation training is the right problem
- But execution focused too much on voice tech, not enough on content/assessment
```

## üéØ PATH FORWARD

**Strategic Questions:**
- [‚úì] What are our options? (continue/pivot/restart/abandon)
- [‚úì] What's the minimum change to get something working?
- [‚úì] What's the risk of each approach?
- [‚úì] What's the time limit for this phase?

**Strategic Options:**
```
Option 1: Continue Current Approach
- Pros: Voice foundation works, can build on existing code
- Cons: Missing 70% of features, no clear path to admin tools
- Time estimate: 6-8 weeks to reach PRD requirements

Option 2: Pivot Approach - Content & Assessment First
- What to change: Build remaining characters, scenarios, assessment engine
- Risk level: Low - Uses existing foundation
- Time estimate: 4-6 weeks for MVP with all core features

Option 3: Restart/Abandon
- Rationale: Not recommended - core tech works
- Decision criteria: Only if voice quality becomes unacceptable
```
