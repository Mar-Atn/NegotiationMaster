## üî• CRITICAL RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE

### **SACRED WORKING COMPONENTS (DO NOT TOUCH)**
- ‚úÖ **Authentication System** - JWT-based login is working perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Voice Integration** - ElevenLabs WebSocket connection is stable
- ‚úÖ **Sarah Chen Character** - Voice conversation functionality operational
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema** - Core tables and relationships established
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Communication** - WebSocket connections functional

### **MANDATORY PROTECTION PROTOCOL**
```
BEFORE ANY CHANGE:
1. git add . && git commit -m "Working state before [change description]"
2. Create backup of affected files
3. Test only the specific feature being modified
4. ROLLBACK IMMEDIATELY if anything breaks existing functionality
```

### **FORBIDDEN ACTIONS**
- ‚ùå NEVER modify authentication middleware without explicit approval
- ‚ùå NEVER change voice service configuration unless voice-specific task
- ‚ùå NEVER alter database schema without backup and migration plan
- ‚ùå NEVER touch working React components unless UI-specific improvement
- ‚ùå NEVER experiment with "quick fixes" - follow systematic approach

## üìä PROJECT MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINE

### **üåÖ SESSION START RITUAL (5 minutes)**
**Before opening any code:**
- [ ] **ONE clear goal** for this session: _________________________
- [ ] **Check working state:** What works right now?
- [ ] **Time limit:** How long will you work? (Max 3 hours)
- [ ] **Branch check:** Are you on the right git branch?

**Quick Status Check:**
```
Current working features: [List - Authentication, Voice with Sarah Chen, Database]
Known issues: [List current problems]
Today's focus: [One specific goal]
```

### **üíæ BEFORE ANY EXPERIMENT**
**Mandatory steps - no shortcuts:**
- [ ] **Commit current state:** `git add . && git commit -m "Working state before [experiment name]"`
- [ ] **Create experiment branch:** `git checkout -b experiment-[descriptive-name]`
- [ ] **Document experiment goal:** What are you trying to achieve?
- [ ] **Set experiment time limit:** Maximum time before evaluation

**Experiment Log:**
```
Goal: [What you're trying to do]
Expected outcome: [What success looks like]
Time limit: [Maximum time to spend]
Rollback plan: [How to get back to working state]
```

### **‚è∞ EVERY 90 MINUTES - MANDATORY CHECKPOINT**
**Stop everything and assess:**
- [ ] **Current status:** Working/Partially working/Not working/Stuck
- [ ] **Progress made:** What's different from 90 minutes ago?
- [ ] **Decision point:** Continue/Pivot approach/Take break/Rollback

**Checkpoint Log:**
```
Time: [Current time]
Status: [Working/Issues/Stuck]
Progress: [What changed]
Decision: [Continue/Change/Break/Rollback]
Energy level: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### **üåô SESSION END RITUAL (5 minutes)**
**Before closing anything:**
- [ ] **Commit all changes:** Even if not working - `git add . && git commit -m "Session end - [status]"`
- [ ] **Update project status:** What works now vs. when you started?
- [ ] **Plan next session:** ONE specific goal for next time
- [ ] **Clean workspace:** Close unnecessary tabs/files

## üß™ TESTING & DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOLS

### **STANDARD TEST ACCOUNTS (Development Only)**
```
Regular User:
- Email: user@user.com
- Password: user
- Role: Standard user access

Admin User:
- Email: admin@admin.com  
- Password: admin
- Role: Admin access for content management

Note: These simplified credentials are for development/testing only
Production deployment will require proper authentication system
```

### **TESTING REQUIREMENTS**
**Before any feature is considered complete:**
- [ ] Works with both test accounts (user and admin roles)
- [ ] Existing functionality unchanged (authentication, voice, Sarah Chen)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Responsive design maintained
- [ ] Voice integration unaffected

### **ROLLBACK TRIGGERS**
**Immediate rollback required if:**
- Authentication stops working for test accounts
- Voice conversation with Sarah Chen fails
- Database connection errors
- Existing React components break
- Console shows critical errors

---

## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE GUIDELINES

### **EXISTING FOUNDATION (DO NOT MODIFY)**
```
Backend Services:
‚úÖ /backend/src/services/voiceService.js - ElevenLabs integration
‚úÖ /backend/src/routes/auth.js - JWT authentication 
‚úÖ /backend/src/server.js - Express server with CORS
‚úÖ /backend/src/database/ - Database connection and schema

Frontend Components:
‚úÖ /frontend/src/components/VoiceConversation/ - Voice UI components
‚úÖ /frontend/src/pages/Login.js - Authentication interface
‚úÖ /frontend/src/App.js - Main application routing
‚úÖ /frontend/src/index.js - React application entry point
```

### **DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS**
**When adding new features:**
- Create new files instead of modifying working ones
- Use composition over modification for existing components
- Add new routes/endpoints instead of changing existing ones
- Implement feature flags for testing new functionality

### **DATABASE GUIDELINES**
- Never DROP existing tables
- Use ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN for schema changes
- Create migration scripts for any schema modifications
- Test all database changes with both test accounts

## üí° CORE PRINCIPLES

### **The One-Sentence Rule**
> "If I can't explain what I'm doing in one sentence, I'm doing too much at once."

### **The Working Version Rule**
> "Always maintain a version that works, even if it's simple."

### **The Time Limit Rule**
> "Every experiment has a maximum time limit and a rollback plan."

### **The Focus Rule**
> "One goal per session. Write it down. Stick to it."

### **The Protection Rule**
> "Working authentication and voice integration are sacred - never touch without explicit approval."
